			<h1>About OdLeaighCreative</h1>
				<p>My name is Shannon O'Donnell and I am OdLeaighCreative. I am a single mother, 
				full-time Content Management, SharePoint, and Technology specialist for the Human 
				Services group at Florida Blue. I suffer from bipolar which is paired with severe 
				anxiety. Because of this, I do not know how to interact with others. I try not to 
				let it run my life, but to some degree it always will.</p>
			<h1>History</h1>
				<p>I started my career as a bookkeeper. However, since I was raised by a helpdesk
				technician, I had a natural talent for all things technology and consistently found 
				myself handling technology tasks. Depending upon the company, these tasks ranged from 
				fixing the printer to designing and troubleshooting code.</p>
				<p>I knew I liked solving problems, so every time I was presented with something I 
				didn't know, I taught myself how to handle it. This included javascript, html, css, 
				visual basic, xml, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, and more.</p>
				<p>In one job, I was asked to handle the ordering for all marketing material for the 
				company, which evolved into designing it as well. This is when I discovered my passion 
				for code and design. I began learning everything I could, but when you learn on the job,
				you only learn the scenarios you come across. Because of this, I was stuck in the boat 
				of not knowing what I didn't know.</p>
				<p>I have been in my current position for almost 4 years, and loving it, so I am now 
				working towards a degree in Information Technology with a focus on Web design and development.
